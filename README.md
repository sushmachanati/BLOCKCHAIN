# BLOCKCHAIN

## *FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY*

## BLOCKCHAIN?

The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.

## BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?

- Blockchain technology is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) — It is an accounting system where the ledger (record of transactions) is distributed among a network of computers.
- So at its core, blockchain technology is a record-keeping tool.
- This network of computers all manage the blockchain together without hierarchy. With such a flat architecture, blockchain networks are often referred to as peer-to-peer networks.
- First, these computers verify all transactions one by one and add them onto a ‘block’ of information. Then these blocks are added to the blockchain and downloaded onto each computer. 
- In a nutshell, this is how these computers keep the blockchain secure and running

## WHAT MAKES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY UNIQUE?

1. Decentralized: 
Because blockchains are managed by a network of nodes rather than a central authority, they are fully decentralized. This prevents any one entity from having any control over the network.
2. Transparent:
Transactions on a blockchain are constantly being recorded and stored on the blockchain across nodes. This means that all participants can view all transactions on the network in real-time.
3. Immutable:
Blockchains are designed to enable permanent record keeping so that stored data cannot be altered after being added. This makes it an extremely stable and reliable record-keeping system.
4. Secure: 
It is hard to change or destroy blockchains because of its distributed nature. For example, if someone hacked into one of the computers on the network and altered information there, the network would remain unaffected.
